# A Chess Openings Reportoire

This site contains my personal notes and opening tree for my own repertoire.
Each page will have a diagram for a single position along with links to
subsequent positions. On many pages there will also be notes about strategic
ideas that can arise in that position. The goal is to eventually build up a
tree which contains every semi-reasonable move my opponents might make in the
openings I play.

All of the statistics on this site come from
[Lichess](https://www.lichess.org). All of the diagrams are generated with the
[Apronus diagram generator](https://www.apronus.com/chess/diagram/editor/).

## Opening moves

From the starging position, I play d4.

Move                | Total games | White wins | Draw | Black wins
--------------------|-------------|------------|------|-----------
[e4](e4/index.md)   | 1,038,423   | 33%        | 42%  | 25%
[d4](d4/index.md)   | 826,559     | 34%        | 43%  | 23%
[Nf3](Nf3/index.md) | 235,288     | 34%        | 44%  | 23%
[c4](c4/index.md)   | 158,750     | 34%        | 43%  | 23%

Still to do: g3, b3, f4, Nc3, b4, e3, d3, a3.
