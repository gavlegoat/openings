# B18: Caro-Kann, Classical Variation

![Position](https://chessboardimage.com/r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/2p3b1/8/3P4/3B1NN1/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R.png)

In this line White offers a trade of bishops but Black isn't forced to accept
it. If White captures on g6, we are happy to recapture with the h pawn and use
the open h file.
