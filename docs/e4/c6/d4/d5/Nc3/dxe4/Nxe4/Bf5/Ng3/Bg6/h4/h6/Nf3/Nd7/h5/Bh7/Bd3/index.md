# B15: Caro-Kann Defense

![Position](position.png)

White offers the trade of light-square bishops. For White, the point is that
black has spent several moves in the opening moving that bishop, so this
effectively gives White a lead in development. For Black, there is no way to
avoid the trade, but the light-square bishop is not the best anyway. The pawn
on e6 in particular restricts its motion.

I play Bxd3 in this position.
