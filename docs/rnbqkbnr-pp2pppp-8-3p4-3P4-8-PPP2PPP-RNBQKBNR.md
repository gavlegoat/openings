# B13: Caro-Kann: Exchange Variation

![Position](https://chessboardimage.com/rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR.png)

We just recapture the pawn here. The important feature of this position is that
white has given up the central pawn majority. Black's plans in a lot of lines
revolve around a minority attack with the a and b pawns.
