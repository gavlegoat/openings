# B13: Caro-Kann: Exchange Variation

![Position](https://chessboardimage.com/rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR.png)

White exchanges the central pawns. I tend to think this line is a little weak
since White is already giving Black a central pawn majority.

In this position I play cxd5.
