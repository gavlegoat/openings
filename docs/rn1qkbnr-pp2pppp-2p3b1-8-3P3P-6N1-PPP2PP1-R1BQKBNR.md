# B18: Caro-Kann, Classical Variation

![Position](https://chessboardimage.com/rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p3b1/8/3P3P/6N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQKBNR.png)

White prepares to attack and trap the bishop with h5, as well as grabbing
some space on the kingside.

In this position I play h6.

## Mistakes

### h5

This is a natural move to try to restrain White's kingside advance, but it
turns out to be too aggressive, and eventually the h pawn will be weak.
