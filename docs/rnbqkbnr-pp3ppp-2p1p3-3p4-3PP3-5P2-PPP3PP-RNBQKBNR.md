# B12: Caro-Kann: Fantasy Variation

![Position](https://chessboardimage.com/rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/3PP3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR.png)

We don't want to capture on e4 in this case because it resolves all of the
problems White accepts by playing f3, while also giving up the central pawn
majority. Playing e6 does block in the c8 bishop, but with pawns on f3 and e4
that bishop has very limited scope on the kingside anyway.

## Continuations

Sometimes people will play Nd2 here but it always transposes into the Nc3
lines after 3... dxe4  4. Nxe4.
