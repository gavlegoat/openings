From here both sides develop pretty normally. White usually castle kingside
since they haven't weakened the kingside with h4-h5. Most commonly Black ends
up castling kingside anyway, despite White's threat to open the h file with
Bxg6. Eventually Black can look to play c5 and launch a minority attack on the
queenside.
