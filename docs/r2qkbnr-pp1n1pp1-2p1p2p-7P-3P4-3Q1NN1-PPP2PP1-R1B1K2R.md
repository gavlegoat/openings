# B19: Caro-Kann, Classical Variation

![Position](https://chessboardimage.com/r2qkbnr/pp1n1pp1/2p1p2p/7P/3P4/3Q1NN1/PPP2PP1/R1B1K2R.png)

Now e6 is just a normal developing move, letting the bishop out and clamping
down on the d5 square.

From here both players develope pretty normally. White will usually castle
queenside since the h4-h5 push has weakened the kingside. Black can castle to
either side or even keep the king in the center, although castling kingside is
most common. The g8 knight will usually be developed to f6 while the
dark-square bishop goes to e7. If the players castle on opposite sides of
course, there will be an attacking race.

One common idea in this position is to respond to 11. Bf4 with 11... Qa5+ 12.
Bd2 Bb4 13. c3 Be7 14. c4 Qc7. This line leaves the queen and bishop on natural
squares while also inducing a weakness in White's queenside. After this
maneuver, a common continuation is 15. O-O-O Ngf6 16. Kb1 O-O, resulting in the
following position.

Here both sides play for their own attack. Black has a5 and b5 while white
needs to play Ne4 and trade knights in order to free their g pawn. This knight
trade will end up giving more scope to the d7 knight.

If Black doesn't want to go into the opposite-side attacks, they can also
choose to castle queenside after Qc7 or Qb6. For example after 11. Bd2 Qc7 12.
O-O-O Ngf6 13. Ne4 O-O-O, we reach this position:

This position is much calmer than the previous one. Black has a slight
advantage in that the h pawn can be weak in an endgame, but White has more
space. White can look to play c4 and attack Black's king while Black can try to
exploit White's kingside weakness.
